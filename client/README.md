## Build tasks

### `gulp bundle`
Creates a production-ready build in the `dist/` directory. On windows, admin rights at needed for symlinking.
The contents of this directory can be uploaded and served to visitors.
You can use `gulp serve-bundle` to check the resulting bundle.

### `gulp watch`
Transpiles to `.dev` (the new "`dist`"). This has been optimized in performance (no unneeded copying of files).
